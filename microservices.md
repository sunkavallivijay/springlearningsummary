### Microservices definition:
- An architectural style
- Small: A suite of small services each running in its own process (micro + services)
- Autonomous: Change to one service doesn't affect consuming services
- Communication: Service communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often HTTP Resource api

### Benefits of Microservices:
- Respond to business changes faster with easy & faster development of focused services
- Technology heterogeneity
- Resilience
- Scaling
- Ease of deployment
- Organizational alignment
- Composability (AKA Composing software for reuse across organization)
- Optimizing for replacability (AKA writting code which is small and can be replaced with newer faster technologies; no legacy code)

### SOA & Microservices:
 Microservices are a specific approach for SOA; Same way as Scrum being a specific approach for Agile
 
### Packages Vs Shared Libraries Vs Modules:
- Packages help seperation of code with in the application
- Share libraries (libs) help share a reusable code
- Modules are similar to Shared Libs but difference is, modules can be deployed as seperate *process*. E.g. are OSGI is one approach that was introduced starting Java 9


### General points:
- Role of Architect in IT should be like a town planner, predicting future possibilities, constantly adapting to the changing landscape and people needs. It should not be like a building architect, which doesn't change with time.
- 

- Seperation of concerns: Modularity and Encapsulation
- Scalability: Horizontal scalaing and work load distribution

### Scaling approaches:
- Horizontal scaling: means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources whereas,
- Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine
