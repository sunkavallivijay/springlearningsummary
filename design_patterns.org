Design patterns are just guidelines

** Creational Design Patterns, 6
Focus is on how an object Or a group of objects should be constructed

* Factory
- Seperate creation of a type or subtypes into a seperate class
- Can return instances of a type or its subtype only
- The subtypes returned by the Factory changes according to the user input
- It provides control on the object creation
- Decision to provide which subtype is based on if..else logic in factory matched with the user input
- Define Interface
- Let subclass decide which class to instantiate
- Construction should not be permitted using `new` keyword

* Abstract Factory
- Its factory of fatories i.e. a (Abstract) factory with if..else to determine the factory that should build the object. The factory here will then build object.
- This can be used when components that make up an object increase for e.g., AnimalFactory that can provide both a dog and a cat but now we want more specific dog or a cat in which case, we will first have a dog factory and a second factory for cats

* Singleton
- Limit instantiated object to *only one*
- Approaches to achieve singleton is: 1. Enums 2.Inner class 3. Double lock/null check with volatile 4.Eager instation

* Builder
- Used when object must be created with many parameters where some are mandatory and others optional
- Uses Inner static builder class to build the Outer class
- Outer class should have private constructor and should be permitted to construct with `new`

- Object pool
- Prototype

** Structural Design Patterns

** Behavioral Design Patterns

* Stategy pattern
- Behavior changes or can be changed dynamically
- This dynamic behavior is implemented as a seperate type (i.e. Interface and implementations) that actual object can establish *has-a relation* with
- Doesn't have any if..else condition to determine behavior but by the object type that relationship established with
- This behavior can be changed by having setter method to which the behavioral Interface type can be set
- This avoid long list of conditions, avoid duplicate code, avoid forcing unneeded methods on Interface types
- Con: Increases number of objects

* Observer pattern
- If many objects wants to know when another object changes, e.g. stock market, when many subscribers to be notified when a stock price changes
- Helps with loose coupling
- Subject to be observed should have methods to registerObserver, unregisterObserver and notifyObserver
- Subsribers will implement Observer which has 'update/notify' method which will be called by the subject Or an additional class that does the notification
