- Static Methods, when to ?
1. Operates only on the arguments
2. Doesn't need an instance to work (i.e. doesn't change state of an object) Or the instance to work is passed as argument
3. Want to call the method without an instance
Note: Static methods cannot be overriden but are hidden, can be overloaded

- Access to methods or variables are based on the type of variable an object is assigned to and not the object itself.
E.g. Consider Animal type and subtypes: cat and dog, if dog subtype has a method digHole() which Animal type doesnt have then,
Animal dog = new Dog(); dog.digHole(); doesn't work as, assignement type which is Animal doesnt know about digHole method

- How can a private method be accessed by other classes when anything can be done with only restriction isto private keyword cannot be changed ?
1. Add a non-private method to the class that internally calls private method
