** Spring Framework Core:
org.springframework.beans/org.springframework.context
org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext Or WebApplicationContext Or ClassPathXmlApplicationContext Or FileSystemXmlApplicationContext

- A spring bean can be defined in 3 ways:
  1. Using XML  2. Using @Component Or @Configuration 3. @Configuration + @Bean

- A bean can be retrieved using ApplicationContext, like:
  ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");
  PetStoreService service = context.getBean("petStore", PetStoreService.class);

  If using spring boot use @Autowrited:
  @Autowrited private ApplicationContext applicationContext;
  PetStoreService service = applicationContext.getBean(PetStoreService.class);

- Within the spring container each bean is represnted as of type BeanDefinition
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-definition

- Explicitly register external object as spring bean by using DefaultListableBeanFactory, provided by applicationContext.getBeanFactory();
- Circular dependency: BeanCurrentlyInCreationException
  https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-dependency-resolution
- To inject prototype bean into singleton bean use:
  1. Implement ApplicationContextAware interface that provides ApplicationContext and then call applicationContext.getBean("B.class");
  2. Using Lookup method injection

** Spring scopes:
  - Singleton scoped bean: Single bean `per container`, and by creating multiple containers, multiple beans can be created of singleton scope. Singleton beans are pre-instantiated when container starts, this is to avoid runtime instatiation problems. Abstract beans are not pre-instantiated and trying to reference them will throw error.
  - Prototype scope: Spring container only creates prototype scoped beans and doesn't manage post creation so, calling destroy methods and other activities must be handled explicitly. the Spring containerâ€™s role in regard to a prototype-scoped bean is a replacement for the Java new operator.
  - Application, Session and Request scopes throw IllegalStateException when used with non-web application contexts, such as ClassPathXmlApplicationContext.
  - Accessing shorter scoped (e.g. Request scoped) beans in a longer scoped (e.g. singleton scoped) bean cannot be correctly achieved using autowring:
  1. Use AOP Scoped proxy 2. Autowire bean as ObjectFactory<MyTargetBean> and call getObject() 3. Use ObjectProvider<MyTargetBean> 4. Provider<MyTargetBean>
  - Method calls inside same call are direct, to route them through proxy, implement @Scope(proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS) on class. This is good case where class level cache is implemented where cached data of method2 result can be accessed by method1 instead of direct method call.
  - Spring's AOP based proxy creates CGLIB proxies, which only intercept public method calls. Alternative is to create JDK interface based proxies by setting proxy-target-class=false, but in this case collaboration must be through an interface.

** Bean lifecycle callbacks:
* Init & destroy:
  1. XML: init-method & destroy-method 2. Implement InitializingBean & DisposableBean 2. @PostConstruct & @PreDestroy 3.default-init-method & default-destroy-method
  - All the init & destroy approaches can be used at sametime, they are called in a specific order, refer:
  https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-factory-lifecycle-combined-effects
  - For Classes that implemented AutoClosable Or Closeable, assign special value `inferred` to the bean definition.
  - Initialization callback is performed immediately after all dependencies/collaborators are supplied when, the bean is still a rawbean without being fully created. AOP proxies only applied on fully created beans so it cannot be applied on Initialization or destroy methods.

* Startup and shutdown callbacks:
  - org.springframework.context.LifeCycle Interface defines contract that a bean implement if it has to perform its own start and stop activities in background when the application context starts and stops.
  - Use org.springframework.context.SmartLifecycle for fine grained control over autostartup as well its startup phases.
  
* Aware Interfaces:
  - Aware Interfaces provide ability to access various configuration beans for modifications. E.g. ApplicationContextAware which provides the implemnented bean with access to ApplicationContext.
  
* Inheritance:
  - A child bean definition inherits scope, constructor argument values, property values, and method overrides from the parent, with the option to add new values. Any scope, initialization method, destroy method, and/or static factory method settings that you specify will override the corresponding parent settings.

** Container Extension points:
* BeanPostProcessor Interface: (org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor)
  - BeanPostProcessor interface operates on a bean instance (i.e. Object) and not on class
  - Helps customize a bean after it is instantiated by spring container
  - All BeanPostProcessors and beans that they reference directly are instantiated on startup, as part of the special startup phase of the ApplicationContext.
  - As AOP auto-proxying is itself implemnted as BeanPostProcessor, neither BeanPostProcessors nor the beans they reference directly are eligible for auto-proxying, and thus do not have aspects woven into them
  - BeanPostProcessor defined in a container will process beans instantiated only in that container. They will not process even if containers are part of same hierarchy.
  - To modify a bean's class definition itself, implement BeanFactoryPostProcessor
  - Multiple BeanPostProcessor's can be implemented and their usage defined by specifying the `Order` in which they should be processed. Order can be specified by 1. Implemnting Ordered Interface 2. Use @Order annotation.
  
* BeanFactoryPostProcessor:
- Helps change the bean configuration metadata itself before spring container instantiates the beans, other than BeanFactoryPostProcessor bean itself.
- Multiple processors can be configured and ordered
- Do not lazy init Bean(Factory)PostProcessor's, they might be ignored if no beans reference them at a later point.
