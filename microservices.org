** Microservices definition:
- An architectural style
- A suite of small services each running in its own process (micro + services)
- Service communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often HTTP Resource api

- Seperation of concerns: Modularity and Encapsulation
- Scalability: Horizontal scalaing and work load distribution

* Scaling approaches:
- Horizontal scaling: means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources whereas,
- Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine
