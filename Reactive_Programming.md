##Reactive Manifesto:

### Reactive systems are:
- Responsive, 
- Resilient, 
- Elastic and,
- Message Driven

### Systems built as Reactive Systems are:
 - more flexible, loosely-coupled and scalable; makes them easier to develop and amenable to change
 - significantly more tolerant of failure and when failure does occur they meet it with elegance
 - are highly responsive, giving users effective interactive feedback

1. Responsive: Responsive systems focus on providing rapid and consistent response times, establishing reliable upper bounds so they deliver a consistent quality of service. Resilient systems are responsive in the face of failure. 
2. Resilience: is achieved by replication, containment, isolation and delegation.
3. Elastic: The system stays responsive under varying workload by increasing or decreasing the resources allocated to service
4. Message Driven: Reactive Systems rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a boundary between components that ensures loose coupling, isolation and location transparency
