###JShell:
REPL implementation for Java

###JPMS: Java Platform Module System
Validate module availablitiy; prevents runtime NoClassDefFound error
Jar version conflicts addressed
Improved security of class access; Limit which classes are accessible outside module (jar)

###JLink:
Create our own JRE; that includes only classes needed to run the program
For e.g. helloword class with print statement might require just 2 to 3 class; we can limit JRE to only those

###HTTP2 Client:
- Easy to use
- Multiple request can be sent in a single connection
- Text and Binary data can be sent
- Asynchronous requests support

###Process Api:

### Private Interface Methods:
- Only usecase:
  To share code between default methods without requiring you to add another default method to the interfaceâ€™s API.

- Constraints:
  can not be abstract, i.e. must contain a body
  can not be overriden
  can only be called in the same source file

### Try With Effectively Final Resources
- If connection is _effectively final_, you can write `try (connection){}` instead of the laborious `try (Connection c = connection){}`

### The diamond operator
- Empty Diamond operator can now be applied to anonymous classes. Previously it must be denoted as using `T` like <T>

### Private Safe Varargs And Less Deprecation Warning:
- No more too many warnings with Depreciation code imports
- @SafeVarargs annotations would cause a compile error when applied to non-final methods prior to Java 9

### New And Improved APIs
### Improved Optional API
